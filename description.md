HOW TO UPDATE THE WIKI

Since it's not possible to include the changes in the wiki into a pull request, here is a way to update the wiki, while still keeping tight control.
1- Create a new repository on your github account, for example, called "Edited-wiki".
2- Clone the wiki repo that you want to update to your local machine somewhere: 'git clone [https://github.com/UNIZAR-30246-WebEngineering/lab1-git-race.wiki.git]'
3- Add a new remote to your local directory, for example: 'git remote add editWiki [https://github.com/YOUR-ACCOUNT-NAME/Edited-wiki]'
4- Make your locally changes and then push them to your github account: 'git push editWiki master'
5-  Submit a issue to the official page (https://github.com/UNIZAR-30246-WebEngineering/lab1-git-race) requesting to the owner of the repo to review your changes and merge them in. Don't forget to include a link to your own repo and describe what you've changed.

In this classes, faculty provides us some classes which try to show us a little demonstration of Spring controllers and some Junit Test for individual method petitions.

SPRING FRAMEWORK:
	Spring is a framework for app developing, it's open source for Java platform.
	Spring framework its made of some modules which provides a range of services, these modules are grouped into Core Container, Data Access/Integration, Web, AOP (Aspect Oriented Programming), Instrumentation, Messaging, and Test.
	(See this diagram for more information: http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/spring-framework-reference/html/images/spring-overview.png).

JUNIT TEST FRAMEWORK:
	JUnit is a Regression Testing Framework used by developers to implement unit testing in Java, and accelerate programming speed and increase the quality of code. JUnit Framework can be easily integrated with either of the following: Eclipse, Ant, Maven. JUnit test framework provides the following important features: Fixtures, Test suites, Test runners, JUnit classes. Fixtures is a fixed state of a set of objects used as a baseline for running tests. The purpose of a test fixture is to ensure that there is a well-known and fixed environment in which tests are run so that results are repeatable. It includes: setUp() method, which runs before every test invocation, tearDown() method, which runs after very test method.

##TRAVIS CI:
Travis CI is distribuited continuous integration service, which supports different languages, used to build and test software projects hosted at GitHub. It allows to connect your GitHub repository and check it after each push. It main advantage is that we could probe our libraries or applications using several configurations without installing them and that is why it uses different runtimes.60
Travis CI could be activated for different repositories. Moreover, it is configured by travis.yml file, which is situated on the root directory of each repository. This file includes information about the language, the building and testing environment and other aspects.
Travis CI supports these languages: C, C++, C#, Clojure, D, Erlang, F#, Go, Groovy, Haskell, Java, JavaScript, Julia, Perl, PHP, Python, R, Ruby, Rust, Scala and Visual Basic.

INSTALLING GRADLE:
	- Windows 7: Gradle requires a JDK to be installed, version 7 or higher. Visit this link to download and more information
		(http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index-jsp-138363.html#javasejdk).
		You can now download Gradle binary only	distribution (https://gradle.org/gradle-download/) and unpack it into a folder on your system.
		Now, right click on "My Computer" and then select "Properties"->"Advance system settings". Next, click on "Environment Variables"
		button, found in "Advanced" tab. Then we want to add 2 new user variable, GRADLE_HOME and PATH. To add a new variable, click on "New..."
		button (from user variables frame).	For GRADLE_HOME variable enter "GRADLE_HOME" into	the input field for "Variable name", and the location
		of the dowloaded gradle into "Variable value". For PATH variable, enter "PATH" and "%GRADLE_HOME%\bin". If PATH existed before we created,
		then we have to edit it. For that, click on "Edit...", and add ";%GRADLE_HOME%\bin" at the end.
		Now you can use the gradle command in any command prompt. Type "gradle -v" to see if works. For build a project, go to the project's
		root folder and type "gradle build". This only works if a "build.gradle" file is well created. Here is the User Guide
		https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/userguide_single.html.
		
		Common errors: 
		- Gradle doesn't find a resource:
			If this happens, building a project will result in a failure. The most common cause is that Windows system looks an
			incorrect folder while searching a Java resource. To fix this, a new user variable must be created (like "GRADLE_HOME" one).
			Name it "JAVA_HOME", and refers to JDK installation folder ("C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.8..." is a possible route). Ultimately,
			edit the variable "PATH" adding ";%JAVA_HOME%\bin" at the end.

HOW TO RUN THE APPLICATION ON THE LOCAL MACHINE

	It's easy to run the application on the local machine. You just have to follow the wiki of the main repository to configure the tools needed. After configure Gradle you can try if compile using the command "gradle check" in the terminal. Once this is well, you can start the application using the command "gradle bootrun". If everything goes fine, the application has been compiled and have started Spring Framework and the application. Now, you can access from your favourite browser by typing in the address bar: "localhost:8080".

SOME OTHER TASKS OF GRADLE 

	In addition to the commands said before, there are other interesting commands:

		- help: Displays a help message.
		- war: Generates a war archive with all the compiled classes, the web-app content and the libraries.
		- test: Runs the unit tests.
		- clean: Deletes the build directory.
		- jar: Assembles a jar archive containing the main classes.

	You can found more tasks if you type the command "gradle tasks" in your terminal.
