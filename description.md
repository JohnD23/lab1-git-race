HOW TO UPDATE THE WIKI

Since it's not possible to include the changes in the wiki into a pull request, here is a way to update the wiki, while still keeping tight control.
1- Create a new repository on your github account, for example, called "Edited-wiki".
2- Clone the wiki repo that you want to update to your local machine somewhere: 'git clone [https://github.com/UNIZAR-30246-WebEngineering/lab1-git-race.wiki.git]'
3- Add a new remote to your local directory, for example: 'git remote add editWiki [https://github.com/YOUR-ACCOUNT-NAME/Edited-wiki]'
4- Make your locally changes and then push them to your github account: 'git push editWiki master'
5-  Submit a issue to the official page (https://github.com/UNIZAR-30246-WebEngineering/lab1-git-race) requesting to the owner of the repo to review your changes and merge them in. Don't forget to include a link to your own repo and describe what you've changed.

In this classes, faculty provides us some classes which try to show us a little demonstration of Spring controllers and some Junit Test for individual method petitions.

SPRING FRAMEWORK:
	Spring is a framework for app developing, it's open source for Java platform.
	Spring framework its made of some modules which provides a range of services, these modules are grouped into Core Container, Data Access/Integration, Web, AOP (Aspect Oriented Programming), Instrumentation, Messaging, and Test.
	(See this diagram for more information: http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/spring-framework-reference/html/images/spring-overview.png).

JUNIT TEST FRAMEWORK:
	JUnit is a Regression Testing Framework used by developers to implement unit testing in Java, and accelerate programming speed and increase the quality of code. JUnit Framework can be easily integrated with either of the following: Eclipse, Ant, Maven. JUnit test framework provides the following important features: Fixtures, Test suites, Test runners, JUnit classes. Fixtures is a fixed state of a set of objects used as a baseline for running tests. The purpose of a test fixture is to ensure that there is a well-known and fixed environment in which tests are run so that results are repeatable. It includes: setUp() method, which runs before every test invocation, tearDown() method, which runs after very test method.

The next instructions will help you to build and run the application:

The first step is to download the project or clone with git (git clone https://github.com/UNIZAR-30246-WebEngineering/lab1-git-race). Now, you can see the code and this information. This code is build with gradle. Gradle is an build automation system which uses configuration files like build.gradle which is a build configuration script. To build the code you have to use gradle: "gradle build" on your terminal. After a few seconds, gradle respond you with "BUILD SUCCESSFUL" that means the build has completed. 

Finally, you can run the project with "gradle bootRun". Now you can verify if the application is running with your browser: go to localhost:8080 and you can see it.
